> A simple note-taking app. (basically another diary app.. but maybe kinda neat ?)

made with fresh ingredients :

- [ ] css
- [ ] html
- [ ] js
- [ ] nodejs

simple enough right? (_ yes _)

## setup locally

- create a `.env` file in the `src` directory.
- set a desirable 4 digit port.
- at this point i assume that you have nodejs so hit up the terminal and start the project using npm start.
- visit the project at https://localhost:$PORT
